1.  _`/node_modules`_: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  _`/src`_ This directory contains the source code of the Finance Tracker backend, including route handlers, middleware, and database models.

3.  _`.babelrc`_ Babel configuration file for transpiling modern JavaScript to a compatible version for Node.js.

4.  _`.gitignore`_ This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

5.  _`index.js`_ The entry point of the application, where the server is initialized and routes are defined.\*

6.  _`package-lock.json`_ (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. _(You won’t change this file directly)._

7.  _`package.json`_: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

8.  _`README.md`_: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
